I made a meme for you  
![meme](/images/todo_meme.jpg)

It basically describes my journey on how to treat TODOs in code.  
  
I started of simple - by writing some TODOitos here and there and basically staying happy about my code.  

Time passed by and I became a little more anxious and more concentrated on quality of the software me and my team writes and we all started to put more things into our Asana task tracker. The tasks there piled up, some of them were nice to do, but they never got enough of time to work on. Worth noting that some of those tasks felt like drudge work from very beginning, a lot of tasks were added as a reaction to nitpicking reviews. Overall the nitpicks level on our code was quite high, and although everyone was happy to address the nitpicks - the speed was at danger.  
More time passed by, I learned that not all nitpicks are really adding value:  
- some are coupling the system too early or introducing needless abstractions;  
- some are completely stylish and opinionated;  
- and most important - some code is written to stay dead forever.  

All above teached me to stay relaxed and less anxious. I also learnt that time is an asset and that some things are "good enough". And finally I know now that some code will never evolve and if&when it does - a TODO here and there might help. And no, it doesn't has to be a task. 

Cheers
