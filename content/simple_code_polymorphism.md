Title: Simple code. Stabbing at polymorphism

Uncle Bob and some other people claim that polymorphism is the default way to structure code.
I want to explore this idea a little bit.

Let's take the example from the book (Chapter 3 Functions, Switch Statements ),
I have transated the java code snippet into python:


```python

def calculatePay(e: Employee) -> Money:
    match e.type
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.COMMISSIONED:
            return calculateCommissionedPay(e);
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.HOURLY:
            return calculateHourlyPay(e);
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.SALARIED:
            return calculateSalariedPay(e);
        case _:
            raise InvalidEmployeeType(e.type)

```
According to the book:
> Due to:
> - First, itâ€™s large, and when new employee types are added, it will grow
> - Second, it very clearly does more than one thing
> - Third, it violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) because there is more than one reason for it to change
> - Fourth, it violates the Open Closed Principle (OCP) because it must change whenever new types are added
> - WORST, there are an unlimited number of other functions that will have the same structure. 
For example we could have:

``` python
def isPayday(e: Employee, date: datetime.date) -> bool:
    ...

def deliverPay(e: Employee, pay: Money) -> None:
    ... 
```


Let's explore what employee types mean? Probably:  
- a COMMISSIONED employee is a sales person who receives a percent of what has been sold;  
- a SALARIED employee is the one receiving a monthly salary, not really concentrated around the number of hours worked  
- a HOURLY employee is the one receiving a paycheck for HOURs * RATE  

Uncle Bob sees `isPayday` and `deliverPay` and other potential funcitons as problematic probably due to those functions also having a structure around:

```python
def isPayday(e: Employee, date: datetime.date) -> bool:
    match e.type
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.COMMISSIONED:
            # at moment of sale
            return True
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.HOURLY:
            # weekly
            return date.weekday() == 0
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.SALARIED:
            # monthly
            return date.day == 1
        case _:
            raise InvalidEmployeeType(e.type)
```
And all those functions are suffering from the 4 reasons above.

The solution to the problem according to the book looks around this:


```python
class EmployeeBase:
    # arguments of functions were not specified, but I assume Bob thinks of extending each - e.g. accepting date as input, etc
    def isPayday() -> bool:
        raise NotImplemented() 

    def calulatePay() -> Money:
        raise NotImplemented() 

    def deliverPay(pay: Money) -> None:
        raise NotImplemented() 


class EmployeeFactory:
    def makeEmployee(r: EmployeeRecord) -> EmployeeBase:
        switch r.type:
            case COMMISSIONED:
                return CommissionedEmployee(r)
            case HOURLY:
                return HourlyEmployee(r)
            case SALARIED:
                return SalariedEmploye(r)
            case _:
                raise InvalidEmployeeType(r.type)
```

The main benefit of this system is that when we decide to add a new employee type - we do not have to change multiple functions, but have to implement only the methods of the `EmployeeBase`.
  
## Issues with this approach

I disagree with the structure conceptually - it is not an Employee who defines the payday and the pay calculated. And most certainly it does not deliver pay.

There are also structural issues:
- to answer the question - "what are the paydays of our employee types" - I have to jump into individual classes and see the logic of each. Same applies to - "how do we calculate the paychecks".
- the class has to accept as inputs all the context around it. See PROJECT example.  
- when adding a Employee - we mix the data and the behaviour. Unlike actual companies - HR add people, Accoouting defines the pay procedures.  
- the share of data between the different calculate methods is not possible - for example how we share the working days calendar / overtime rates / etc  
- **what we do if the employee is both SALARIED and COMMISSIONED?**  


**PROJECT:**
Let's for example introduce the new type of employee - `ProjectEmployee`, which is in charge of running the projects and receives pay 2 weeks after the project he runs is finished. 

So the payday function may look like:

```python
class ProjectBasedEmployee:
    def isPayday(project: Project, date: datetime.date) -> bool:
        if not project.is_finished():
            return False
        if date + datetime.timedelta(days=14) == project.finish_date:
            return True
        return False
```
 We can not call the method the same way for any employee type. We have either have to reveal the type and get the projects, or the method has to be capable of accessing `ProjectStore` directly. So we either have to inject the data (list of projects), inject the dependency (a project store) or let sideeffects happen - function accesses ProjectStore directly. Same applies to COMMISION. 
I will let the reader deside if that is a valid concern or not.


## Solution
At the moment when we realised that nothing blocks the Employee to be both SALARIED and COMMISIONED it should be clear that concepts of "how we pay an Employee" is not the same concept as "what is an Employee". 

We may better structure the code according to the ongoing processes (domains):


```python
# payroll.py

def isPayday(e: Employee, date: datetime.date, pay_type: PAY_TYPE) -> bool:
    match pay_type:
        case PAY_TYPE.COMMISSIONED:
            # at moment of sale
            return True
        case PAY_TYPE.HOURLY:
            # weekly
            return date.weekday() == 0
        case PAY_TYPE.SALARIED:
            # monthly
            return date.day == 1
        case _:
            assert_never(e.type)  # this makes new types being added not an issue (in type checked code)


def calculatePay(e: Employee) -> Money:
    match e.type
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.COMMISSIONED:
            sales = get_sales(e)
            return calculateCommissionedPay(e, sales);
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.HOURLY:
            return calculateHourlyPay(e);
        case EMPLOYEE_TYPE.SALARIED:
            return calculateSalariedPay(e);
        case _:
            assert_never(e.type)  # this makes new types being added not an issue (in type checked code)

...

```
So we may keep the original switch statements and functions despite the reasons listed in the book:
- an emloyee may have multiple pay_types, e.g. an employee is both on salary and has the commission from sales;  
- the functionality of accounting is placed in a single accounting file;  
- we do not make the Employee master of it's own payroll. Which both matches business needs and is easier to navigate the concepts.  


Polymophism is a hint that we are putting a certain behaviour onto the object, while it might not be cohesive enough to the object and might have a great dependency on context around it.  

### **The key idea is that we should take great care in introducing new abstractions. Introducing a new abstraction is potentially harmful and the benefits gained should address complexity in different way than number of `switch`es**
